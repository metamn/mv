Vue components for metamn

## Testing

- both unit and e22 tests are running fine

## Documentation

- vue-styleguidist is the only one to have inline + markdown documentation support
- vue-play and storybook docs has to be written separately from the component which is nonsense
- vue-stylegudist cannot document HTML, CSS, and just a very limited JS (props, methods)
